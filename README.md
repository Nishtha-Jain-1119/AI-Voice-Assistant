# AI-Voice-Assistant
The project aims to develop a personal-assistant. Analyzing and
designing a voice assistant tool using Artificial Neural Network draws its inspiration from
virtual assistants like Crotana for Windows, and Siri for iOS. It has been designed to
provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing
certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant either through 
voice commands or using keyboard input.
